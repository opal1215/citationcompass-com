# APA x YouTube Citation Guide

**TL;DR**: How to cite YouTube in APA7. In-text: author/channel + year + optional timestamp. Reference: author/channel, year or n.d., title in sentence case with [Video], platform YouTube, URL.

YouTube is a common source. Under APA 7th edition, you typically need: the author or channel, the upload date (use n.d. if not available), and the video title (sentence case) with [Video] in the reference entry, followed by the platform and the URL.

## Examples

- In-text: (CrashCourse, 2015)  
- Reference: CrashCourse. (2015). The French revolution [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTTvKwCylFY

For special cases (no author, no date, Shorts, livestreams, timestamps, etc.), see the related pages in this site.
