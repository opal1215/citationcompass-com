# No author

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="When a YouTube video has no personal author, use the channel name as the author in both the in‑text citation and the reference list entry." />

Many YouTube videos are uploaded by channels rather than named
individuals.  In APA style, the uploader’s screen name or channel
serves as the author.  Place the channel name in the author
position of the citation.

<DataBox title="Example with no author">
  <p><strong>In‑text citation:</strong> (Veritasium, 2021)</p>
  <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Veritasium. (2021, June 4). Why are 96,000,000 black balls on this reservoir? [Video]. YouTube. https://youtu.be/UX_jPmz0n14</p>
</DataBox>

If the channel uses a pseudonym or handle, use that as the author.  Do
not add "YouTube" to the author element; the platform is given
later in the reference.  For group channels or organisations, list
the organisation as the author.
