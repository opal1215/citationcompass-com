# APA6 vs APA7

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="APA7 simplified video citations compared to APA6. It emphasises using the channel as the author, includes [Video] to denote the medium and allows retrieval dates for undated content." />

The 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual introduced several
changes for citing online videos.

* **Channel as author.** APA7 clarifies that the uploaderâ€™s name or
  channel should be treated as the author.  In APA6, authors were
  sometimes omitted.
* **Medium in brackets.** APA7 explicitly includes the medium, e.g.
  **[Video]**, whereas APA6 relied on context.
* **Simplified retrieval.** APA7 removes the phrase "Retrieved from"
  before URLs unless a retrieval date is needed (e.g. for
  undated content), making citations shorter.

APA7 also improves clarity for citing undated and archived content.  It
is now the recommended style for most academic writing.
