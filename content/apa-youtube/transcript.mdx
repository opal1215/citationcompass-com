<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="When quoting a transcript of a YouTube video, cite the video itself and include a timestamp in the in‑text citation. Do not cite the auto‑generated transcript as a separate source." />

YouTube provides autogenerated transcripts for many videos.  When you
quote from a transcript, you should still cite the video itself.
Include a timestamp in your in‑text citation to direct readers to
where the quoted words occur in the video.

Do not cite the transcript itself as a separate source; the video is
the primary source.  Always double‑check the transcript against the
video audio to ensure accuracy.
