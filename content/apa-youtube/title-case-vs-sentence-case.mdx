# Title case vs. sentence case

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="APA style uses sentence case for video titles in the reference list: capitalise only the first word and proper nouns. Title case (capitalising major words) is not used for video titles." />

One common mistake is to capitalise every major word in a video title
as you might for a book title.  APA requires **sentence case** for
video titles in the reference list: only the first word and proper
nouns are capitalised.

<DataBox title="Example of sentence case">
  <p><strong>Title in sentence case:</strong> How black holes warp space and time</p>
  <p><strong>Wrong (title case):</strong> How Black Holes Warp Space and Time</p>
</DataBox>

Sentence case creates consistency across citations and makes
references easier to read.  Use title case only for the names of
journals, magazines and newspapers in your reference list.
