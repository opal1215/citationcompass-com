<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="When citing a podcast episode on YouTube, identify the hosts as authors, include the date, the episode title in sentence case, [Audio podcast episode], the production company, and the URL." />

Some podcasts publish video versions of their episodes on YouTube.  If
the content is principally audio and also available as a podcast, APA
recommends citing it as an **[Audio podcast episode]**.  List the
hosts in the author position, followed by the date and the episode
title.

If the podcast does not have a separate audio feed and is only
available as video, cite it as a regular YouTube video instead.  Use
your judgment to decide which format better reflects the source.
