<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="For live streams, cite the date the stream occurred and include the usual elements: author, date, title, [Video] and URL. If the stream is archived, treat it like a normal video." />

Live streams on YouTube can later be watched as recordings.  When
citing a stream, include the date of the live event and the title in
sentence case.  You may indicate the medium as **[Livestream]**
instead of **[Video]** to signal that the content was originally
streamed live.

<DataBox title="Example livestream citation">
  <p><strong>Reference:</strong> SpaceX. (2022, April 23). Crew‑4 mission launch [Livestream]. YouTube. https://youtu.be/xyz987uvw</p>
  <p><strong>In‑text:</strong> (SpaceX, 2022)</p>
</DataBox>

If the stream has been archived and is indistinguishable from a
regular video, it is acceptable to label it as [Video].  For
streams that are no longer available online, treat the citation as a
personal communication and cite it only in the text.
