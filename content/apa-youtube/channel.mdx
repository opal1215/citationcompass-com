# Channel

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="To cite a YouTube channel, use the channel name as the author and include (n.d.) for the date. Add [YouTube channel] in square brackets and include the retrieval date if relevant." />

Sometimes you need to reference an entire YouTube channel rather than
a specific video.  In that case the channel itself becomes the
author and there is no publication date.  You identify the channel
with the phrase **[YouTube channel]** in square brackets.

<DataBox title="Example channel citation">
  <p><strong>Reference:</strong> National Geographic. (n.d.). [YouTube channel]. YouTube. Retrieved August 30, 2025, from https://www.youtube.com/@NatGeo</p>
</DataBox>

The in‑text citation simply consists of the channel name: (National
Geographic, n.d.).  Including a retrieval date is optional but
recommended when citing a channel, because channel content can change
over time.
