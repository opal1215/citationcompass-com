# In‑text citation

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="APA in‑text citations for YouTube videos include the author or channel name and the year of upload. If you refer to a specific moment, add a timestamp (HH:MM:SS) after the year." />

In the body of your paper you acknowledge a source with a brief
parenthetical citation.  For YouTube videos, cite the author or
channel and the year of upload.  Separate the elements with a comma
and enclose the citation in parentheses.

If you are pointing readers to a specific moment in the video, add
the timestamp after the year.  Use the format **hours:minutes:seconds**.

<DataBox title="Example in‑text citations">
  <p>(CrashCourse, 2015)</p>
  <p>(Khan Academy, 2020, 00:01:23)</p>
  <p>(TED, n.d., 00:10:05)</p>
</DataBox>

When the author is unknown, the channel name should be used.
If the upload date is not available, use **(n.d.)** to indicate
"no date".  For multiple citations within the same parentheses,
separate each with a semicolon.
