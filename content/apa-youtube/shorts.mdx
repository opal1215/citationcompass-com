<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="YouTube Shorts are cited the same way as any other video. Provide the author or channel, upload date, title in sentence case, [Video], the platform and the URL." />

YouTube Shorts are brief vertical videos, but APA treats them like
standard videos for citation purposes.  Include all the usual
elements in your reference.

<DataBox title="Example Shorts citation">
  <p><strong>Reference:</strong> BBC News. (2023, March 15). How does the James Webb Telescope work? [Video]. YouTube. https://youtube.com/shorts/abc123def</p>
  <p><strong>In‑text:</strong> (BBC News, 2023)</p>
</DataBox>

There is no need to indicate that the content is a Short.  The
platform (YouTube) and the [Video] label already convey the medium.
As with all citations, assess the credibility of the source
carefully.
