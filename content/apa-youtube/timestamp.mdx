# Timestamp

<AnswerCard title="TL;DR" tldr="Include a timestamp in the in‑text citation when you quote or paraphrase a specific segment of a YouTube video. The timestamp is formatted as HH:MM:SS and follows the year." />

Timestamps help readers locate the exact moment in a video that you
are discussing or quoting.  To include a timestamp, add it after
the year in the in‑text citation, separated by a comma.

  <p>(Veritasium, 2021, 00:02:45)</p>
  <p>(CrashCourse, 2015, 00:10:30)</p>
  <p>(TED, n.d., 00:00:15)</p>
</DataBox>

The timestamp does **not** appear in the reference entry.  Keep the
timestamp simple and concise—usually hours, minutes and seconds.  If
you refer to a range, provide the starting time.
